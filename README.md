# Project #8: Insulin Control
# Configuring an Artificial Pancreas for Closed-Loop Monitoring of Blood Glucose

● Incorporated a glucose monitor and insulin pump with the defined control algorithm for the biofeedback pathway                
● Integrated proportional, integral and derivative (PID) with model predictive control (MPC) to account for variance          
● Refined parameters of adaptive control to maintain a glucose homeostasis set-point between 4 and 6 mmol/L
